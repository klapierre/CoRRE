Notes on merging CoRRE datasets

4 main datasets
(1) ExperimentInfo.csv - has all the treatment information for each experiment
(2) RawAbundance.csv - non-standardized abundance for each experiment
(3) RelativeCover.csv - standardized cover within a plot at each experiment (what fraction out of 100% cover)
(4) ANPP2020.csv - anpp data for all experiments which provide it


When using cover data, 3 sites have cover in both biomass by species and percent cover. Filter one of these options out so do not have repeated data within a site
AZI_EELplot, CDR_BioCON, & Sil_NASH
