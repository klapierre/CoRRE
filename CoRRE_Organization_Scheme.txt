CoRRE database file organization

DropBox folder contains all the datafilee
All of the code is on the GitHub - it is important to have this downloaded for to source the online datasets to update!

DropBox (Kim Owner)
Main folders are
(1) Contacting Data Providers - this folder is mostly for soliciting the new datasets in 2020. It also contains the species list sent to the data contributors for the species provenance collection. 

(2) Figures - this folder is currently empty, but has folders to put maps of the sites and summary stats that may be commonly used (for website or otherwise)

(3) Presentations - CoRRE talks given by Meghan or Kim - useful to use old slides and whatnot

(4) Products - A folder for completed manuscripts. 

(5) Data - This is the most important folder! Sub-folders explained below
 - OriginalData: The folders in here have all the data as it is given to us. It is split into sites, traits, species provenance, and 2020 update. 
	The 2020 update can likely be deleted after the one site is added that I have not gotten to yet. Otherwise, I filed them into the other folders. 
	There are two files in here (CoRRE_experiment_locations.csv & USA_species.csv) that are needed for cleaning. 
	Sites has all the data provided by the data contributors - these are the main inputs into the cleaning scripts.
	Traits has all the TRY data in it
- CleanedData: Split into sites and traits folders 
	Sites has two sub-folders. ANPP csv has all the cleaned ANPP datasets and Species csv has all the cleaned species composition datasets
- CompiledData: This is the folder with the main datasets used for analysis (e.g., the most important folder!)
	RawAbundance, RelativeCover, ANPP2020 - these are the merged files
	ExperimentInfo lives in this folder too - useful for merging and subsetting out standardized treatments
	corre_plot_size.csv is filled out to the best of my ability at this time point
	site_location.csv has all the Lat and Long for each location, and MAT and MAP
	Folder for species lists - hoping this can be used to look at what new species are added with each update
	SpeciesProvBySite is the compiled species provenance datafile
	several treatment summaries that are generated in the experiment_info R script
- CoRREExperimentPapers: at least one paper per experiment in here
- Data_Summaries: three excel spreadsheets that track different aspects of the database
	Data_Log is the most basic - just what components of the dataset we have for each experiment
	ExperimentContactInfo - most useful for emails for each experiment
	Experiment_list - Information about each experiment
- Metadata: All the excel files for each site
-TRYCoRREMerge: All the fun trait associated files needed for merging TRY and CoRRE

GitHub (Kim owner)

There are 3 text files in here - this one, one for merging notes, and one for data processing

- DatasetCleaningCode: has an R script for most sites for cleaning data. There are several sites that were edited before in excel only - those don't have code if the original data was not available
-MergingDatasets: has R scripts for merging abundance data, anpp data, creating the experimenting file, and adding site locations.. I also put old code in there for creating a map of the sites. I have not looked at this code, so may need updating
-Traits: has R scripts for cleaning trait data and merging CoRRE and TRY
-SpeciesProvenanceCode: Scripts for combining the species providers datasets and one for pulling info from Konza
